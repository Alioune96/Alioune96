I will be using this file for daily updated on my current journey to be the best programmer i can be during my time at Tech Elevator. For those who don't know, Tech Elevator is an coding bootcamp that aims to teach both back-end and front-end development. 
i'm extremely excited, and this journal aims to keep track of my daily progess. 
Day 1: Today was my first day, and we mostly worked with the command line to be able to check on our files in our system and how we are able to use GitLab to extract our homework. Once we are able to recieve our homework, we then had to work on an series of challenges and use the terminal to check if it was correct. It was an good day, but i need to still play with it more to fully understand it. On to day two!
